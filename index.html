                        Bangladesh is a land of opportunities. There has always been a lively debate on the possible direction of the nation’s economy. Sometimes it appears as a myth that can surprise many, to see that the economy is still growing in a respectful fashion; maybe not in a planned manner, but the bottom line is the economy is expanding despite barriers. The consumption pattern is changing and is on the rise, and the economy has a substantial amount of prospects for further and rapid growth.

                    <p class="para-text dev-p">My grandfather and father came from rural Bangladesh. In the village, every household had a cow -- or wanted one. Rural children would spend most of their time with the cows, goats, or chickens. There was not much for the children to play with back then, so the animals were among the most essential things in their lives. They played with them, looked after them, and fed them. Children would get together and discuss the newborn calf or the hatching chickens. Animals were the centre of people’s lives</p>
